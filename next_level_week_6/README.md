## ðŸ’» Introduction

- This project was developed in the `Next Level Week 06` event. In this event, we built a API to create and send compliments to users of a given Company. This api is capable of:
  - Create `USERS`
  - Edit user data
  - Edit user password
  - Log in with registered users
  - Delete `USERS` from database
  - create `TAGS` to store all the compliments made from users
  - Delete `TAGS` and all the compliments from this tag
  - Create `COMPLIMENTS` to users, which have to be linked to a given `TAG`
  - Delete `COMPLIMENTS`
